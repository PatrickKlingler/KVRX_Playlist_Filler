Instructions:
Navigate to your spotify playlist on the spotify app

click the ellipsis under the playlist name to get the dropdown

select 'Share' and click 'URI'

This will copy the 'Playlist URI' to your clipboard, this contains a number version of your playlist and username

Run the playlist filler and you will see a dialog box like this:

Paste the URI you copied into the box and hit submit, it will then open up a browser and fill in all of the tracks, you can 
then change the playlist name and date and description, although I will work on making that an option to input on the app.
